# Bengali-Speech-Emotion-Recognition-on-SUBESCO

## Bengali Speech Emotion recognition is one of the major outstanding and novel pieces of work  in the Bengali signal processing and the field of Bengali Artificial Intelligence (AI). A plethora of applications such as interactive consultancy, AI customer care services, etc requires identifying the emotion of the caller to give an appropriate response. The audio of human speech consists of various tones from the cochlea and vocal cords. Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Chroma, Gamma -Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (GFCC), and Mel spectrogram are already state-of-the-art techniques to extract various features from human speech audio. In our study, a recently published dataset called “SUST Bengali Emotional Speech Corpus (SUBESCO)” is used to get the raw audio files for different emotions in the Bengali Language. MFCC, Chroma, and Mel-Spectrogram techniques are used to extract the features for each audio file in order to apply different Classifiers and RNN i.e. LSTM (Long Short Time Memory). We test and also compare 3 approaches: 1) Our proposed Neural Network model, 2) Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier, and 3) Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier (MLPClassifier). Using our self-developed architecture, we achieve an overall accuracy of 83.33% with better average precision and f1-score than the SVM classifier and MLPClassifier in detecting 7 different emotion classes.
